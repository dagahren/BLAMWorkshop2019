# Data management & Reproducible research
## What is it?
NSF definition from Goodman et al (Science 2016):
*Reproducibility refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator.*   

Do we agree?

Perhaps we should be talking about "Methods Reproducibility"

> It is not the truth, or even an approximation of truth
> Reproducing the same bias/mistake = same (wrong) results

## Reproducible Research
If most researchers think this is important,   
why are we not working reproducibly?   

What are the obstacles?

## Translation
<section style="text-align: left;">
**Approximate translation:**   
Here under are the ashes of a man who had the habit of postponing everything to tomorrow.   
However, he bettered himself on his last day in life, and actually died on the 31st of Jan 1972.

## Fear
**F: Fusion**
- Fusing the topic with bad thoughts about failure:   
"I can not do this"   
"It is too hard"   
"It will take me too long time"   

## fEar
**E: Excessive Goals**
- We get excited and want to change everything immediately    
This leads to to unrealistic expectations and a high risk of failure!   
 Hard to keep up long term   

## feAr
**A: Avoidance of Discomfort**
- All types of change will feel uncomfortable and unfamiliar at first   
Avoiding discomfort, taking the easy way out (=no change)   
Change is scary!   

## feaR
**R: Remoteness from Values**
- Easy to loose goal and purpose   
"Why am I even doing this?"
