# Data management & Reproducible research
## What is it?
NSF definition from Goodman et al (Science 2016):
*Reproducibility refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator.*   

Do we agree?

Perhaps we should be talking about "Methods Reproducibility"

> It is not the truth, or even an approximation of truth
> Reproducing the same bias/mistake = same (wrong) results

## Reproducible Research
If most researchers think this is important,   
why are we not working reproducibly?   

What are the obstacles?

## Translation
<section style="text-align: left;">
**Approximate translation:**   
Here under are the ashes of a man who had the habit of postponing everything to tomorrow.   
However, he bettered himself on his last day in life, and actually died on the 31st of Jan 1972.

# What does Science say?

<img class="plain" src="Presentation/images/FEAR.png"; style="max-width:1200px;float:center;">

## Fear
**F: Fusion**
- Fusing the topic with bad thoughts about failure:   
"I can not do this"   
"It is too hard"   
"It will take me too long time"   

## fEar
**E: Excessive Goals**
- We get excited and want to change everything immediately    
This leads to to unrealistic expectations and a high risk of failure!   
 Hard to keep up long term   

## feAr
**A: Avoidance of Discomfort**
- All types of change will feel uncomfortable and unfamiliar at first   
Avoiding discomfort, taking the easy way out (=no change)   
Change is scary!   

## feaR
**R: Remoteness from Values**
- Easy to loose goal and purpose   
"Why am I even doing this?"

# Comments?
## What I aim to cover   

- File names
- Project and File structure
- Version control
- Dos & Don'ts

## Possibly discuss (if time allows and you are interested)
*Note: I am not expert in all these topics*

- Backups   
- Programming tips   
- Containers   
- Workflows and pipelines   

# The technical bits!   
# File names
## File names
>- Use extentions to guide you (.txt .csv .fastq)
>- Name files so that it is easy to understand and describe where it comes from (AT1_R1_trimmed.fq)
>- Avoid any label that implies order relative to other files (Final1.txt UltraFinal.txt This_is_my_Final_Final_version2.txt)

## File names

<img class="plain" src="Presentation/images/xkcdFilename.png"; style="max-width:400px;float:center;">

# Project and File structure   
## Project and File structure  
**Time: 10 minutes plus time for sharing**   

- Make a mind map to visualise the process of one of your projects.   
  Be as detailed as you can regarding files needed and produced. Is external data required?   
  
- How would you like to structure this project? Draw a management plan on a new piece of paper.   
  Include files, folder structure, project structure and external resources required   
  
  - Put the two pieces of paper up for viewing by others.

## My take on a strategy

- Totally fine if you have another strategy,  
  but remember that chaos does not count as a strategy!!   
  
<img class="plain" src="Presentation/images/MessyDesk.jpg"; style="max-width:400px;float:center;">    

## Project

- Good descriptive name of project, e.g ArcticMetatranscriptome   
- Include information about the goal and reasoning for the project  *README*    
   
   
- Data   
- Analysis   
- Docs   
- Scripts   
- Progs   

##  Data
  Read-only, raw data and meta data   
  This is an exact **COPY** of the data at the start of the project   
  
## Docs
  Put documentation (e.g Rmarkdown, Notes etc)   
  
## Scripts
  Scripts, such as sbatch, bash, R scripts etc   
  
## Progs
  Store software installed locally, also keep source code   
  
##  Analysis
  Make a separate folder for each of the steps in the analysis
  I like to number them to get a nice order

## So you have a Project and File structure
   
**Now what?**

# Version control
## Git & Github
*What is Git?*   
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 
   
<BR>
    
*What is GitHub?*  
GitHub is a web page were git repositories can be shared. It is a essentially social platform for code. Good for most things that fit with Git.

## Git is distributed

## Basic git workflow

<img class="plain" src="Presentation/images/git+workflow_fullwidth.png"; style="max-width:600px;float:center;">

## Shortlist of the most useful terms in git
> stage (add)   
> commit    
> push   

> pull   
> clone   
> branch   


## Github Setup   
Sign up to Github
https://github.com/

Create a new Github repo for this workhop   
*Give the repo the name of your project*

*Check the box initialize this repository with a README*

## RStudio project
- File-> New Project -> Version Control -> Git   
Paste in the git hyperlink found on the github repo page under 
Clone or download-> SSH

- Update your project and file structure based on the discussions from your peers.
Save the changes, click the Git tab on the top right window -> commit -> push    
<img class="plain" src="Presentation/images/rstudioCreateProject.png"; style="max-width:300px;float:left;">   

## Alternatively you can do it from RStudio (let not bother for now)
- Start RStudio and make a new project, make sure that the check box for git is checked   
>File -> New Project -> New Directory -> Empty Project

<img class="plain" src="Presentation/images/rstudioCreateProject.png"; style="max-width:300px;float:left;">   
<img class="plain" src="Presentation/images/rstudioNewProject.png"; style="max-width:300px;float:center;">   

## Make directories in the Rstudio project
- Create a directory structure using your favourite system:   

>- In your graphical interface (Finder for Mac, Explorer for Windows)   
>- mkdir in terminal (BTW, this can be done inside of RStudio as well)   

## Share your repo
In Github repo: -> Settings -> Collaborators -> Search by email of Github username

## Recommendations
- Commit on a regular basis, ideally when one set of work has been performed and tested.
- Write short descriptive comments to each commit
-

## It is all about you!
- Find ways that work for you and stick to them
- Recognise your favourite excuse
_ Resist the temptation of procrastination  
- Move in small steps   
- Set goals that are realistic   


## Use peer pressure (in a positive way)
- Share github repos!
- Meet and discuss your research projects
- Be the spearhead of change in your respective groups!
